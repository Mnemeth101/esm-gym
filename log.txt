* working through setting up the baseline generation strategies and skeleton code
* confirmed that the entropy that we get from forward_and_sample is the probabilities (_softmaxed_ logits) and not the logits themselves. So I don't have to mess around with client.logits()
[x] working on implementing EntropyBased and MaxProbBased decoding for naked sequences - without structure input
[x] implement structure input

- finished metrics
- finished benchmarking suite
[ðŸŸ¡] running EntropyBased benchmarking on T1123-D1, 50 runs. Okay not T1123-D1, marked as sequence of concern >:(   Doing 1121-D2
[] MaxProb
[] design, test simulated annealing method (looks like they may have implemented closed source?)
