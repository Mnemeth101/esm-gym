"Based on internal research, there's not a benefit to iterative decoding past 20 steps."

"Besides, for both ss-match and cRMSD, we use 10 reference proteins randomly chosen from datasets in Dauparas et al. (2022) and report the mean of the results."

- just should make sure that it's outside the training set of ESM3. *Maybe choose 10 proteins solved in the last year*.

"Iterative decoding and single-pass decoding have equivalent performance for structure prediction. We hypothesize that this is because ESM3 has a latent representation of structure, so whether structure tokens are decoded in a single pass or iteratively does not meaningfully change the sampling trajectory.
